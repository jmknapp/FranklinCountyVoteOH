        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The 2025 Columbus City Council District 7 race between <strong>Jesse Vogel</strong> (progressive challenger, 
            resident of District 7) and <strong>Tiara Ross</strong> (establishment Democrat, resident of District 7) 
            was an <strong>at-large citywide election</strong> where all Columbus voters could participate, regardless 
            of district. The results revealed a stark divide between the progressive Left and the traditional Democratic 
            base: Ross, endorsed by the Franklin County Democratic Party, dominated among Black voters and working-class 
            neighborhoods citywide, while Vogel's progressive challenge found support primarily in white, college-educated, 
            gentrifying areas.

            <strong>Note on Columbus City Council Elections:</strong> While candidates must reside in their district, 
            the elections are at-large citywide races, meaning all Columbus voters participate in choosing each council member.

                A close race that exposed deep fissures within Columbus Democrats. Ross's victory was built on the 
                traditional Democratic base - Black voters and working-class neighborhoods - while Vogel's progressive 
                challenge found its support among white, college-educated newcomers.

        <h2>Geographic Voting Patterns (Citywide)</h2>
        
        <h3>Majority-Black Precincts (125 precincts citywide, &gt;50% Black)</h3>
        <p><strong>Average Vogel Support: 25.4%</strong> (citywide average across all majority-Black precincts)</p>
        
        <p>These precincts strongly favored Ross, with some precincts showing overwhelming support:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Strongest Ross Support:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>COLUMBUS 13-B: 85.3% Ross (60.5% Black, 7.9% college)</li>
            <li>COLUMBUS 06-A: 84.8% Ross (74.2% Black, 15.4% college)</li>
            <li>COLUMBUS 13-C: 79.6% Ross (89.8% Black, 2.4% college)</li>
            <li>COLUMBUS 06-C: 78.8% Ross (88.0% Black, 15.5% college)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Exceptions (Vogel Won):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>COLUMBUS 04-B: 56.0% Vogel (54.0% Black, <strong>25.9% college</strong>)</li>
            <li>COLUMBUS 04-D: 53.4% Vogel (59.0% Black, 13.6% college)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The exceptions were precincts with higher educational attainment, suggesting education played a moderating role.</p>
        
        <h3>Non-Majority-Black Precincts (423 precincts citywide, ≤50% Black)</h3>
        <p><strong>Average Vogel Support: 51.4%</strong> (citywide average)</p>
        
        <p>
            Vogel performed significantly better in whiter, more educated precincts, building a coalition typical of 
            progressive challenges to Democratic establishments: well-educated newcomers in gentrifying neighborhoods 
            rather than the party's traditional working-class base. However, even winning these precincts 51.4% to 48.6% 
            wasn't enough to overcome Ross's overwhelming margins in majority-Black precincts.

        <ol class="key-findings">
            <li>
                <strong>Race Was the Strongest Predictor:</strong> The % Black in a precinct had a correlation of 
                -0.744 with Vogel support, meaning higher Black populations strongly predicted Ross support. This 
                was slightly stronger than the % White correlation (+0.752).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Education Mattered, But Less Than Race:</strong> College education positively predicted 
                Vogel support (r = +0.625), but this effect was weaker than the racial divide.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Income Was Irrelevant:</strong> Unlike presidential races where income often correlates 
                with voting patterns, median income showed essentially zero correlation (r = +0.006) with candidate 
                preference in this local race.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Education-Race Interaction:</strong> In majority-Black precincts, those with higher 
                education levels (like COLUMBUS 04-B at 25.9% college) were more likely to support Vogel, suggesting 
                education moderated but did not eliminate the racial voting divide.

        <h2>Comparison to Other Races</h2>
        
        <h3>Presidential Race (2024, Franklin County)</h3>
        <p><strong>Correlations with Democratic (Harris) Support:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>% Black: <strong>+0.542</strong> (positive)</li>
            <li>% White: <strong>-0.507</strong> (negative)</li>
            <li>Median Income: <strong>-0.316</strong> (negative)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>
                <strong>Key Difference:</strong> In presidential races, Black voters overwhelmingly support Democratic 
                candidates. In CD7, they continued to support the Democratic candidate - but the <em>establishment</em> 
                Democrat (Ross), not the progressive challenger (Vogel). This represents an intra-party divide, not a 
                left-right ideological shift.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Abortion Rights Issue 1 (2023)</h3>
        <p><strong>Correlations with "Yes" (Progressive) Vote:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>% College: <strong>+0.172</strong> (positive)</li>
            <li>% Black: <strong>+0.237</strong> (positive)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Even on ballot issues, Black voters aligned with progressive positions. The CD7 race represents a 
            significant departure from this pattern.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Possible Explanations</h2>
        
        <h3>1. The Democratic "Machine" vs. Progressive Insurgency</h3>
        <p>
            Tiara Ross had the endorsement of the Franklin County Democratic Party, giving her institutional support, 
            established relationships with Black community leaders, and the resources of the local party apparatus. 
            Jesse Vogel ran as a progressive challenger, explicitly or implicitly critiquing the Columbus Democratic 
            establishment - a machine that progressives argue prioritizes developer interests, downtown business elites, 
            and political patronage over community needs.
        </p>
        
        <h3>2. Trust and Community Ties</h3>
        <p>
            Black voters in District 7 appear to have trusted the establishment Democrat they know over the progressive 
            challenger they don't. Ross's connection to the Democratic Party establishment - often criticized by the 
            Left as corrupt or compromised - may have been a feature, not a bug, for voters who see that establishment 
            as responsive to their community.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3. Skepticism of Progressive Newcomers</h3>
        <p>The voting pattern suggests that working-class Black residents may view progressive activists with skepticism, 
        seeing them as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Outsiders who don't understand the community</li>
            <li>Gentrifiers whose "progressive" values mask displacement</li>
            <li>Idealists whose policy preferences (e.g., police reform, development opposition) don't align with 
                community priorities around safety and economic opportunity</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4. Different Definitions of "Progressive"</h3>
        <p>
            What progressives criticize as the Democratic "machine" - patronage, relationships with business interests, 
            pragmatic deal-making - may be seen by working-class Black voters as how things get done. Meanwhile, the 
            progressive platform - heavy on social justice rhetoric and opposition to establishment power - may resonate 
            more with college-educated activists than with residents focused on material needs.
        </p>
        
        <h3>5. Gentrification as the Subtext</h3>
        <p>The stark demographic divide suggests this race was really about neighborhood change:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vogel's Coalition:</strong> White, educated newcomers who identify as progressive and want 
                council representation that reflects their values</li>
            <li><strong>Ross's Coalition:</strong> Long-term residents, particularly Black voters, who want representation 
                that understands their history and won't accelerate displacement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The irony: the "progressive" candidate's support base was the gentrifying population, while the 
            "establishment machine" candidate represented community continuity.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>This race reveals tensions between two competing visions of Democratic politics:</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>National Progressive Coalition</strong> (presidential races, ballot issues):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strong support from communities of color</li>
                <li>Strong support from young, educated voters</li>
                <li>Unified against Republicans</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Local Progressive Insurgency</strong> (challenging Democratic establishments):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Support from college-educated activists and professionals</li>
                <li>Opposition from traditional Democratic base (Black voters, working class)</li>
                <li>Divided within the Democratic Party</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>CD7 Reality:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vogel (progressive challenger): Strong support from white, educated gentrifiers</li>
                <li>Ross (establishment Democrat): Strong support from Black, working-class neighborhoods</li>
                <li>The "progressive" challenge came from the demographic group most associated with displacement, 
                    while the "machine" candidate represented community stability</li>
            </ul>

                <li>
                    <strong>The Progressive Paradox:</strong> Challenging the Democratic establishment may alienate 
                    the party's traditional base, creating a coalition that looks more like gentrification than justice.

                <li>
                    <strong>Trust Matters More Than Ideology:</strong> Working-class Black voters chose the "machine"

                    from gentrifying neighborhoods.

            <h3>For Understanding Columbus</h3>
            <p>The CD7 race reveals deep tensions in Columbus's rapidly changing neighborhoods:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Democratic Machine Has a Base:</strong> What progressives criticize as the Columbus 
                    Democratic "machine" retains strong support from Black voters and working-class communities who 
                    see it as responsive to their needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gentrification Creates Political Divides:</strong> Newcomers and longtime residents have 
                    different political priorities, even when both identify as Democrats or progressives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Class and Education Trump Shared Racial Politics:</strong> College-educated activists 
                    don't automatically speak for working-class communities of color, even on "progressive" issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Progressive Challenges Face Legitimacy Questions:</strong> When your coalition is whiter 
                    and more educated than your opponent's, claims to represent marginalized communities ring hollow.

        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>
                The Columbus City Council District 7 race demonstrates that progressive challenges to Democratic 
                establishments face a fundamental problem: their coalition often consists of the very people 
                displacing the communities they claim to champion.

            <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Key Takeaways:</h3>
            <ol class="key-findings">
                <li>
                    <strong>The Democratic Base Chose the Machine:</strong> Black voters citywide backed the Franklin 
                    County Democratic Party's endorsed candidate by a 75-25 margin in majority-Black precincts, 
                    decisively rejecting the progressive challenger despite his ostensibly more "progressive" platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gentrification Created an Inverted Coalition:</strong> The progressive challenger's support 
                    came from white, college-educated newcomers - exactly the demographic associated with displacement - 
                    while the "establishment machine" candidate represented community continuity for longtime Black residents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Education Trumped Race:</strong> While race was the strongest predictor of voting 
                    (r = -0.744 with % Black), the pattern was driven by class and education. College-educated voters 
                    of all races were more likely to support Vogel, but working-class Black voters overwhelmingly chose Ross.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Two Meanings of "Progressive":</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In national politics, "progressive" means multi-racial coalition against Republicans</li>
                        <li>In local politics, "progressive" often means educated insurgents against Democratic establishments</li>
                        <li>These two definitions create incompatible coalitions</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Trust and Legitimacy Matter:</strong> The Columbus Democratic "machine" - criticized by 
                    progressives as corrupt and beholden to developer interests - retains deep trust among Black voters 
                    who see it as delivering for their communities. A progressive challenge from gentrifying neighborhoods 
                    lacks legitimacy.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">
                <strong>The Broader Pattern:</strong> This race may represent a template for urban Democratic politics 
                in rapidly gentrifying cities. As neighborhoods change, progressive challenges to establishment Democrats 
                increasingly pit newcomer activists against traditional working-class bases, with the ultimate irony that 
                the "progressive" position gets associated with displacement rather than justice.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The race reveals that in Columbus, as in many cities, the fault line within the Democratic Party is not 
                primarily ideological - both candidates are liberals - but rather about community, trust, class, and who 
                has the right to speak for neighborhoods in flux.
